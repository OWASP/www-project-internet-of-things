The OWASP Internet of Things Project is designed to help manufacturers, developers, and consumers better understand the security issues associated with the Internet of Things, and to enable users in any context to make better security decisions when building, deploying, or assessing IoT technologies.

The project looks to define a structure for various IoT sub-projects separated into the following categories - **Seek & Understand**, **Validate & Test**, and **Governance**. Right now, you can find the following active and upcoming OWASP Internet of Things projects:

### Seek & Understand

| **Project** <img width=200/> | **Project Leader(s)** <img width=200/> | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
 <img width="270"/> [IoT Top 10 ](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project#tab=IoT_Top_10) | <img width="270"/> Daniel Miessler <br/> Aaron Guzman  <br/> Vishruta Rudresh <br/> Craig Smith | ![IoT Top 10 2018](/assets/images/OWASP-IoT-Top-10-2018-final.jpg) <br/> Top ten things to avoid when building, deploying or managing IoT systems. Below is a text version of the 2018 list.  <ul><li>I1 Weak Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords</li><li>I2 Insecure Network Services </li><li>I3 Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces/li><li>I4 Lack of Secure Update Mechanism</li><li>I5 Use of Insecure or Outdated Components</li><li>I6 Insufficient Privacy Protection</li><li>I7 Insecure Data Transfer and Storage</li><li>I8 Lack of Device Management</li><li>I9 Insecure Default Settings</li><li>I10 Lack of Physical Hardening</li></ul>
 [IoT Top 10 Mapping Project](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project#tab=OWASP_IoT_Top_10_2018_Mapping_Project) | Aaron Guzman <br/> José A. Rivas | ![IoT Top 10 2018](/assets/images/20142018iotMapping.png) <br/> Provides mappings of the OWASP IoT Top 10 2018 to industry publications and sister projects.
 [IoTGoat](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project#tab=IoTGoat) | Aaron Guzman <br/> Fotios Chantzis <br/> Paulino Calderon | ![IoTGoat](/assets/images/blue-logo-text.png) <br/> IoTGoat is a deliberately insecure firmware based on OpenWrt. The project’s goal is to teach users about the most common vulnerabilities typically found in IoT devices. The vulnerabilities will be based on the top 10 vulnerabilities as documented by OWASP: https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project. IoTGoat is expected to be released in 2020.

### Validate & Test

| **Project** <img width=200/> | **Project Leader(s)** <img width=200/> | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
<img width="270"/> [Firmware Analysis Project](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project#tab=Firmware_Analysis) | <img width="270"/> Craig Smith | The Firmware Analysis Project provides: Security testing guidance for vulnerabilities in the "Device Firmware" attack surface, Steps for extracting file systems from various firmware files, Guidance on searching a file systems for sensitive of interesting data, Information on static analysis of firmware contents, Information on dynamic analysis of emulated services (e.g. web admin interface), Testing tool links, and a site for pulling together existing information on firmware analysis
 [Firmware Security Testing Methodology (FSTM)](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project#tab=Firmware_Security_Testing_Methodology) | Aaron Guzman | ![FSTM](/assets/images/cover_ofstm.png) <br/> The Firmware Security Testing Methodology is composed of nine stages tailored to enable security researchers, software developers, consultants, hobbyists, and Information Security professionals with conducting firmware security assessments. <br/> GitHub: https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm
 [ByteSweep](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project#tab=ByteSweep) | Matt Brown |  ByteSweep is a Free Software IoT security analysis platform. This platform will allow IoT device makers, large and small, to conduct fully automated security checks before firmware is shipped.

### Governance

| **Project** | **Project Leader(s)** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
Catalogue of IoT regulatory policies and Certifications | <img width="270"/> TBD | TBD
